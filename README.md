# Bootstrap-Portfolio

This improved version of my portfolio required me to use Bootstrap CSS framework to layout my work and make it more responsive. I was requried to commit often, ensuring that these commits were descriptive. I felt that this project would be an excellent opportunity to resolve many of the issues I had with my original portfolio.

##Challenges

The first challenge I came across was identifying how best to approach the task - I didn't want to simply copy and paste my old code nor did I want to completely rewrite it. I found that using bootstrap allowed me to copy code but tweak it to my needs, blending my code into new code.

I found it difficult to size the pictures into their cards, so spent lots of tiemr esearching how best to do this. I realised that part of the issue was that I was beeing overly particular about their being white space around an image. This allowed me to recognise that applying the responsive classes from bootstrap into my cards was a possibiity. I experimented with copying and pasting classes from other components to see what would happen. I ended up with a result I was happy with.

One final challenge I encountered was idenitfying where missing divs were - keeping track of an accidental deletions was tricky. I found that I used the inspect tool often to support me in recognising where issues were arising. For example, I tried to apply one background colour to the portfolio section, but the colour was applied to the rest of the page. This is when I noticed some of my divs were not correct. Once I had corrected them, my page worked far better.

##Things I learned

I took great pride in learning how to apply Bootstrap and tweak the code to suit my needs. I found it relatively easy to use and debug. I have learnt that Bootstrap is a great way to reduce time and repetetive coding.
